I'm currently a third year at University of California, Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, although I'll probably emphasize computer science over electrical engineering.

Some of my hobbies and interests include pc gaming, unicycling, woodworking, minimalism, web development, etc.  Lately, I've been studying Operating Systems with hopes of some day working on Google's ChromeOS.

Also, please check out my latest project, [2Day's New Tab Page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/2days-new-tab/mnfdbhnkhijiebcpcfobpfjdhfejjkem?authuser=1), a chrome extension that displays your bookmarks, upcoming google calendar events, weather, time and date on your chrome new tab page!  It also includes a notes box synched to your google account, the ability to open an entire folder of bookmarks at once, and a customizeable background.
