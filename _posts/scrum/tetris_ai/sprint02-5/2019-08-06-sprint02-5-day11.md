#### Daily Objectives

* Rewrite the collision function to be more robust

#### Notes

The if statements check if a collision DOESN’T exist.  So if I use the same if cases, there’s no way to tell if its a left or right collision.  What’s the minimum I need to check to determine if there’s a left collision?

(aabb1.max.x > aabb2.min.x) && (aabb1.max.x < aabb2.max.x) && yCollisions

I need to make sure that aabb1.max.x lies somewhere between aabb2’s min.x and max.x.
I might also need to ensure that aabb1.min.x < aabb2.min.x?  Else, aabb1 might just be inside aabb2’s x boundary.  
Maybe for efficiency, we can make separate functions for checking?  I can add .isLeft and .isRight functions for checking collisions.  The functions will assume that there already exists a collision.  I just need to figure out what common assumptions you can make so I don’t have to recheck anything.

True Assumptions if collision exists:
> aabb1.max.x > aabb2.min.x  
> aabb1.min.x < aabb2.max.x  
> yCollision

ifLeftCollision:
> min1 < min2

ifLeftCollisionOnly:
> min1 < min2
> max1 < max2

ifRightCollision:
> max1 > max2

ifRightCollisionOnly:
> max1 > max2
> min1 > min2

Assumption for all of the above: collision exists  
Ok!  I’ve implemented the direction collision stuff.  I had a minor run in with having all the values flipped, cause y values on html5 canvas go from top to bottom.  
I need to fix the actual resolution functions though, since it doesn’t handle edge cases yet for when there’s both x and y collisions.
