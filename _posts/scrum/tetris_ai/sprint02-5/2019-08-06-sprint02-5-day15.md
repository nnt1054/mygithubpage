[Sprint Summary](/blog/projects/tetris-ai-sprint-2-5)

#### Daily Objectives

* Make some sort of normal progress for the node_module (slow saturday)

#### Notes

Basically I’m just gonna read up a bit more on developing node modules
Scoped vs Unscoped:
* Only unscoped packages can be published to the public registry
* A scope allows you to create a package with the same name as a package created by another user or Org without conflict
* Ex: ‘@npm/package-name’ and ‘@npmcorp/package-name’, where two different package-name’s have different scopes

So we can add other dependencies in a custom node package, but I’m a little confused on how to reference/include it.  So I think the project isn’t gonna be contained within
