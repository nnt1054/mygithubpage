#### Daily Objectives

* THIS IS AN OFF DAY BUT IM CHOOSING TO DO WORK SO NO EXPECTATIONS HERE.

#### Notes
Let’s outline the game engine?  
“The core functionality typically provided by a game engine includes a rendering engine ("renderer") for 2D or 3D graphics, a physics engine or collision detection (and collision response), sound, scripting, animation, artificial intelligence, networking, streaming, memory management, threading, localization support, scene graph, and may include video support for cinematics.”

The Game Engine needs to:
* Handle rendering
* Scripting, etc.
Hmm :thinking:  
Global setting variables?

Game Engine:
* Takes the current scene and renders it
* Calls update and render functions at appropriate intervals
Handles input

Scene:
* Assumes update functions are being called at appropriate intervals
* Holds game variables
