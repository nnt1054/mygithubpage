[Sprint Summary](/blog/projects/tetris-ai-sprint-2-5)

#### Daily Objectives

* Today is a break day xd

#### Notes

Where did I leave off?  I’m adding ColliderTriggers and ColliderPhysics.
What’s the difference between ColliderTiggers and ColliderPhysics.  ColliderPhysics run an update at every update loop, while ColliderTriggers only run functions when a collision is detected.
