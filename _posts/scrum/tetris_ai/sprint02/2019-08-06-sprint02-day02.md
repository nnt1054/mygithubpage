<b>Product:</b> Tetris2P AI  
[Sprint Summary](/blog/projects/tetris-ai-sprint-2)

#### Daily Objectives

* Figure out the data structures
* Start fleshing out the game logic and game loops in pseudo code
* Start implementation and coding

#### Notes

So to start off, we’re creating a 10x25(?) grid  
I need to take note of initial orientations of each piece  
* Each piece starts in their ‘flattest’ orientation
* Only appears on the 20th row initially

Each piece rotates in a 4x4 square  
Each piece will have a ‘reference’ point at the bottom left most square of the 4x4 square  
The orientations of each piece will be described in reference to that reference point  
* Ex: Orientation 1 of the orange L piece will use up (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) and (3,1) spaces

The ‘reference’ point doesn’t have to be confined within the 10x25 since the orientation of a piece doesn’t always fill the (1,1) square  
KICKS: when a tetris piece tries to rotate, but a square(s) would overlap with where it would rotate into, a kick occurs
* The piece is just shifted either upwards or sideways until its in a legal position  
* However need to figure out how to prevent abuse  
	* OH the game can transition between using drop speed and lock delay  
	* Once there’s is a static piece underneath the piece, switch to the lock delay, instead of drop speed (make sense since shouldn’t be able to drop anymore).  After each rotation check if there’s still a static piece underneath the piece, if not then reset to the lock delay and switch back to drop speed

Lock Delay: time before a piece touching the ground waits before locking in its position
* <s> I don’t think this is something I need to implement cause it just needs to move downward again to lock? </s>
* Nvm just realized this is necessary since the drop speed is different from the lock delay
* Are there any situations where a piece can no longer rotate?
	* Floor and Wall Kicks can only move max 2 spaces in any direction; if every kick is invalid, then the piece won’t be able to rotate

Things I need to figure out, for implementation:
* How to have multiple loops running?
* I’m concerned about code optimizations and efficiency
* I made an html5 game a long time ago when i started learning javascript
	* Ran into major optimization issues cause I did some makeshift collision detection between every single bullet and every single enemy :) 

Side note we’re assuming Object Oriented Programming  
Things to consider for optimization:
* Sprite sheet? Probably unnecessary for initial tetris game, but might do add ons later for aesthetic purposes
	* Actually at one point sprites are more optimized than canvas ctx objects apparently
* Use integers apparently
* OOP or ECS
	* I took notes on this but for unity instead
	* I can look at other examples, but tbh I shouldn’t over engineer this lmao
* This is still a bit down the road but should look up lobby making and stuff
	* I think i have reference image for that from yesterday’s thing though so its fine for now

I think for now I should look at coding examples first? And then figure out the OOP Objects based off that and this tetris game.  
I think it’d actually just be better to build a standalone single player gamer first to get down all the mechanics, so I will do just that  
Should I consider incorporating React into this game?
* React is a framework for updating content on a web page when new information is updated.  We have socket.io though and an actual game loop so I think it’s unnecessary.
I want make the entire game without using a template probably?  
* I can go back and using my old html5 game canvas code, BUT I need to learn how to implement timers and periodic events and fps sort of stuff
* requestAnimationFrame()
* This [website](https://isaacsukin.com/news/2015/01/detailed-explanation-javascript-game-loops-and-timing) is BERRY useful
Need to think more about controls, move on key down, but not again until key up
* Later want to do fast moving left and right
Notes from this link: [website](https://isaacsukin.com/news/2015/01/detailed-explanation-javascript-game-loops-and-timing)
* ‘Lockstep’ ensures all players are playing at the same pace
	* Drop a player if there’s lagging too much
* Velocity and other time based variable need to be scaled based off of the ‘delta’ variable, which represents the amount of time that has passed between rendering frames
	* delta = timestamp - lastFrameTimeMs where lastFrameTimeMs is the timestamp for the last 
	* Only run update() when delta > timestep
		* Timestep is a fixed value
		* Reduce value of delta by timestep after update()
		* var timestep = 1000 / 60;
	* After a certain number of update loop steps:
		* Discard un-rendered frames, and hard update to server state
	* Increase timestep if update loop takes too long
