<b>Product:</b> Tetris2P AI  
[Sprint Summary](/blog/projects/tetris-ai-sprint-2)

#### Daily Objectives
* Figure out game structure and create main menu scenee

#### Notes

First things first, lets draw a mockup or the game client
![client server](/assets/scrum/sprint2day4image1.png){: class="column post-image" }
{: class="column"}

What VIew’s/Game Modes/Screens do we need (in the context of adding buttons to the screen/UI)
* Sprint Mode
* VS Random Opponent
* VS AI
* Create Lobby(?)
* Join Lobby
* Settings

THIS IS IMPORTANT UI WORK OK; Main Menu Buttons:
* Marathon/Practice
	* Secondary game menu(?)
		* restart 
		* Exit to main menu
		* Play AI
		* settings
	* Quickplay
		* Random matchmaking
		* Eventually can include account and mmr if i wanted to
			* Save mmr using cookies or something
	* Create Lobby
		* join lobby using url
	* Settings
		* controls/speed/ui customization/etc
		* control global setting variables

UI SHOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE RN
* Issue is having similar menus for different UI’s
* I’m really into Top-Down approach apparently

Ok we’re going to uh:
* During gameplay always show the two tetris ‘instances’
* Leave second one blank, if single player mode
* If lobby and no second player yet:
	* Display invite code on empty tetris instance
* In lobby with second player:
	* Display name on second tetris instance, also maybe ready status
* In lobby:
	* Ready Up button/status
	* Spectate or Join game button
* During Game/In Lobby: Press ESCAPE to show menu:
	* Leave to Main Menu Button
	* Settings button or button settings

OK ENOUGH WITH THE HECKING UI AND BUTTON WORK:
Let’s talk game and game Pieces
* Tetris Game Instance (2x)
	* Held Piece
	* Piece Queue
		* Will be moved to match instance object instead later
	* Game Grid
	* Current Tetriminos
	* Lines Sent
	* KO’s
	* Game Timer
* Tetrominos (parent class for all tetrominos, make subclass for each type)
	* Anchor Position
	* Tetromino Type/Shape
	* Current Orientation
	* Orientation Number
	* Orientation Dictionary
* Tetris Match Instance
	* Tetris Game Instance (2x)
	* Piece Queue
		* This is to make sure both instances have the same queues
	* Match Timer

So App Instance > Tetris Match Instance > Tetris Game Instance > Tetrimono Instance
Game Instance update function (delta passed as parameter):
* Check if time to drop piece in this update
	* If piece, can’t drop further:
		* Lock piece to stack
		* UpdateGameState() // defined below
		* break()
* If update function continues:
	* Process input(s):
		* need to check for short presses and long presses
		* Perform action on short press
		* Perform long press action on set intervals
			* Applies to both rotating and moving pieces
	* If hold piece:
		* Update held tetromino piece
		* spawnNewTetromino()

UpdateGameState() //occurs after a piece is locked
* Update cells in game grid based on locked piece
* If line cleared:
	* Clear row(s) in grid
	* Shift other rows downward
	* Calculate combo streak
* If no line cleared:
	* Add Trash Lines
	* Check if ToppedOut
		* Either EndGame() or addKO(), removeTrash()
* spawnNewTetromino():
	* If unable to:
		* Either EndGame() or addKO(), removeTrash()

oh HECK how do you do animations with html5 canvas  
Should I process input first or not; probably do drop first  
Uh make sure to remember, to check game stuff based on the Match Timer and not a time elapsed function  
Make general purpose function for checking if a piece is touching a floor
* Can use same function for creating ghost  
Only need to check game state when game state changes:  
* GameState only changes when a piece is dropped
* Trash Lines will only appear if a piece has dropped
Incorporate ‘Scenes’ and ‘GameStates’
* Scenes:
	* MainMenu
heck im already stressed again
Create separate files for scenes and objects
* MainMenuScene
* SinglePlayerScene
* LobbyScene
Main.js starts the actual game, creates the actual game and canvas
* Main.js handles the update loop and is the object for the actual game/screen
* Main.js handles switching between Scene Objects
* Main.js handles all the global variables and settings
* MAIN.JS IS THE GAME CLIENT
