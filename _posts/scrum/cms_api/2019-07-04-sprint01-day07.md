#### Notes
Last Day of the Sprint (bonus bonus day smiley)  
I think most of the website architecture is figured out now.  Just needs to be drawn out and finalized.  
Still also need to figure out how to do the configurable databases and stuff?  The answer is an installation script!!! Create a script that runs all the necessary CLI commands to set things up, especially with the write databases, and can make prompts to get answers from the user.  Basically the script runs: ‘npm init, npm install, etc etc’.  Hopefully I can find a few good examples, but this puts into perspective how things get set up.
