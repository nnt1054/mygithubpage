<b>Product:</b> CMS API  
[Sprint Summary](/blog/projects/cms-sprint-1)

#### Daily Objectives
1. Continue Working on the Software Design Document

#### Notes

I’m gonna be working on an airplane so hopefully I can actually focus

Should I add a section specifically for the microservices?  If I want to write more and in depth about them I think they deserve their own section

Differentiate between management services and interface services?

Wait heck I need a legit content management service between the API’s and the Bookshelf ORM

NEED TO FIX THE API GRAPH

Don't forgt to mention the non-distributed system:  
"May I ask why would you bother build a distributed system when you are not going to distribute it at all ?” LOL I’m getting called out so hard
