<b>Product:</b> CMS API  
[Sprint Summary](/blog/projects/cms-sprint-1)

#### Daily Objectives
1. hey

#### Notes

Ok so where was I lol, I’m still on the architecture design portion aha
Let’s go find that reference sdd i was looking at first

Should I figure out how I’m splitting the sections  
Software Architecture:

1. Introduction
2. Description
	* Microservices API
	* What are the different Microservices
	* API Gateway and Microservice Communication
	* Description of Actual Microservices
		* REST API
		* GraphQL
		* AdminUI
		* User/Role Management
		* Client Sites (?)
		* Talk about Database and ORM
3. Reasoning and Purpose
	* Why did I choose a Microservice API
		* Normal Microservice reasoning
		* Easier to process and understand
		* Easier to add on additional services
		* Easier to deploy and scale as a distributed system
	* Why is it not actually distributed?
		* Ease of deployment
4. Implementation
	* Node.js Express
	* Express Sessions to handle login sessions for both the API in the API Gateway
	* BookshelfORM
5. Other Notes
	* Authentication

I wanna talk about microservice communication too  
API gateway routes using child routers to each microservice
* To split into a distributed system, Turn each child router into their own express application and deploy and scale each as necessary

Should I make a separate section for talking about API Design?  I need to show I’ve actually made progress into the uh API design?  I think API design could be it’s own section?  Let’s include the API design in the ‘Procedural Design Section’, maybe even create a draft of the API documentation.

BDUF (Big Design Up Front) btw
