<b>Product:</b> CMS API  
[Sprint Summary](/blog/projects/cms-sprint-1)

#### Daily Objectives
* Learn AdobeXD
* Get a decent mockup of just the front of the admin page

#### Notes
Hello lol this is gonna be Daily Scrum #2 :)

Let’s figure out what I’m doing first
1. Format and post Daily Scrum #1
2. Do Daily Scrum #2

I guess I’ll think about it a bit more, at least just for the admin views:  
As an admin, I want to be able to:  
1. Look at projects as if I were a client (adding and editing entries)
2. Create new content types and edit current ones
	* What happens when you edit a collection or content type though?
	* I think it’s best to make the ‘Articles’ a ‘content item’, so a blog post could consist of a Title(‘string’), Author(‘User/String’), CoverImage(‘media image’), Articles(arrangement of paragraphs, bullet points, lists, headers, medias’)
		* A simple WYSIWYG editor will be useful to use or include
			* The client site can handle everything individually


Is there any point to a home page?

Daily Goals:
Learn adobe xd
Get a decent mockup of just the front of the admin page
