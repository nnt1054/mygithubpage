### Overview
<b>Product:</b> CMS API  
<b>Sprint #1:</b> June 10 - June 14  
<b>Goals:</b>

1. Have a comprehensive Design Document prepared for the project
2. Have a high spec wireframes and user flow diagrams/journeys made for the Admin console
3. Have a high level overview of the software architecture

<b>Method/Metrics:</b>  
The goal has been met once I've written up and published the design document and wireframes for the project.  The goal is also to have the remaining sprints also already planned out.

### Daily Scrums
I don't think its quite necessary to make a new separate page for each every daily scrum, so I'll compile all my notes and everything here.

#### Monday - 06/10/2019

##### Daily Objectives:
1. Have Low-Spec Userflow diagram
2. Have Low-Spec Wireframe

##### Notes:

##### Lessons Learned:

##### Plans for Tomorrow:




<!--Hey haha I'm still in the planning stage for the planning stage.-->
<!--How do you even start a 'product'?  In general, most people will start off by just making an MVP (minimum viable product), but if I'm going for a BDUF (big design up front) kind of thing, I want to make a sprint entirely just for the planning stage?-->

<!--Basically determine resources, collections which are sets of resources, URL's which are paths to resources.  -->
<!--And then try and determine the HTTP methods.  Another question to consider would be whether or not to create POST and UPDATE endpoints, since technically you should only be updating the content through the ADMIN api.  If I choose to include the POST and UPDATE endpoints, would the admin interface somehow make use of this?  -->
<!--Along that topic, should I make the API itself first or the admin interface?  On a different note, don't forget to use HTTP response codes! Also support filtering through the API and not just through the admin.-->
<!--Also think about mimicking wordpress's guidelines and usability. -->

<!--#### Tasks To Do-->

<!--1. Write out description of project and specifications-->
<!--2. Draw out infrasctructure diagrams-->
<!--3. Make low spec to high spec wireframes-->
<!--4. figure out implementation and design architectures-->
