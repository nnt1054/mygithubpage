#### Overview
2Day's New Tab replaces the default chrome new tab page. Personalize your own new tab page with a custom wallpaper you get to upload. 2Day displays your Google Calendar events in a fun responsive schedule interface. It also displays your important bookmarks as well as bookmark folders. Clicking on a bookmark folder will open each bookmark inside in a new tab. Lastly, time and date is displayed in a large clock in the bottom left corner.

This project originated as an unfinished hackathon project that I picked up and continued.  This extension served as a good initial project to get comfortable with Javascript, REST API's and designing user interfaces.
