This overview page is still a work in progress

#### Overview
I'm developing an online multiplayer Tetris2P game, along with an AI/ML Agent for the public to play against.

#### Scrum
I'm still figuring out how to improve user navigation for this website, but you can find the scrum board for the project over [here](/portfolio#project).

* [Sprint #2 - Creating the Tetris Game](/blog/projects/tetris-ai-sprint-2)
* [Sprint #2.5 - Developing an HTML5 Game Engine](/blog/projects/tetris-ai-sprint-2-5)


#### Background

After the loss of <a href='https://tetrisfriends.com' class='hover-underline' style='color:blue'> tetrisfriends.com</a>, I wanted to develop my own Tetris client with the Tetris Battle 2P format/rule set along with a computer AI built from scratch.  Following Googleâ€™s AlphaStar as an example, the end goal is to teach the AI different Tetris strategies, from simply surviving to 4-wide and T-Spin strategies.  I also hope to exercise my AI knowledge from college courses as well as to learn more about game development architectures.

#### Current Roadmap

1. Creating the Game Engine - MOSTLY COMPLETED
2. Make a Single Player Tetris Game
3. Introduce Multiplayer and Deploy Game Online
4. Research and create Tetris AI/ML Agent
