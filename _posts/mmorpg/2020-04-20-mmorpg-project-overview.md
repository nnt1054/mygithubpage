# Project Goal:
* The goal of this project is to build a scalable 2D MMORPG game and server

# Project Spec:
* Built using node.js, Socket.io, Express.js, MINI5.js (TBD)
* Deployed using Kubernetes and Docker

# Technical Challenge(s):
* Creating a scalable game server where in-game regions/chunks are divided among several (horizontally scaling) server instances
* Creating portable code for both the application and its CICD/Infrastructure Services

# Personal Objectives (for me, Neil Toledo):
* gain a better understanding of networking architecture and implementation with emphasis on newer modern technologies (Kubernetes)
* become more proficient in writing technical documentation
* become more proficient in full stack engineering by improving my skills in
* networking technologies and client/server communication
* infrastructure orchestration
* game design and development
