#### Description:
The CDN Asset Server will be used to deliver game assets and sprite sheets to the Client.  For now the "CDN" won't really be any different in the backend and will just be used as an endpoint for where to query game assets.  The plan is to use some sort of library for sending several assets and creating a loading/progress bar for the client side.
