#### Introduction:
Not actually much of a Scrum Board but I needed a place to document and breakdown tasks in a way similar to Jira tickets and stories.

#### In Progress/To Do:
* Strip WebSocket code from mini5-engine source
* Add ENGINE_MODE variable to mini5-engine to run as 'server', 'client', or 'local'
* Create BaseClientScene.js and BaseServerScene.js to use as parent for other scenes
* Reorganize Relevant WebSocket functions and callbacks to appropriate files
	* strip from mini5-engine module
	* can implement into client/index.js, server/index.js for now
	* should move to dedicated client.js, server.js files later
* ...

#### Backlog:

#### Completed:
