## Duality
Duality is the phenomenon where for any *primal* LP, there exists a *dual* LP that are both optimal for the same question.  The main idea is for any max LP, we can create a min LP that returns an upper bound for the primal question by introducing a set of non-negative multipliers.

## How to find the Dual LP
1. Multiply each constraint by a multiplier, *y<sub>i</sub>*
2. Combine constraints into one inequality
3. Factor out the original *x<sub>i</sub>* variables
4. Use primal objective to write new dual and nonnegativity constraints
