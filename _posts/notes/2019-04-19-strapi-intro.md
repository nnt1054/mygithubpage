#### Intro
Developing a portfolio website for a 'client', and would like to handle it as a an actual client job.  I would like to deploy an online CMS for my client to log into and be able to update their own content on their site.  In order to achieve this, I'll be deploying a Strapi application on heroku and hosting the actual site using Surge.  I will also look into using React and Gatsby for the site, but I'm not quite certain what they do yet.
