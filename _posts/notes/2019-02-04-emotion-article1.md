Concerns:
- ensure both sets are simple random samples of the data
- make sure code is optimized for large data sets
- only load/parse in "training" and "validation" partitions instead of entire data set


Affect Valuation Theory:
- "ideal affect": how people want to feel  
- "actual affect": how people actually feel  
ideal and actual affects differ, and cultural factors has bigger influence on the "ideal"
note: HAP, LAP = high, low arousal positive states


EA's value high-arousal positive affects, while CH/AA value low-arousal positive affects; this can be tied into differences of 'self-concept' between cultures (EA's value more indivuality, CH/AA value self-concepts regarding social roles)


Ideal Affect Differs from Actual Affect  
emotional experience expressed through: valence, arousal
-pure and interactive component (overlapping/non-overlapping variance between ideal and actual)

Cultural Factors Shape Ideal Affect  
goal: examine whether ideal and actual differ, culture influences ideal more than actual


Study 1:  
-participants asked "how would you IDEALLY like to feel b/w slightly and extremely
-then asked to "rate how much you TYPICALLY feel each of the following items on average"
-administered self-construal test which assesses individualistic and collectivistic self-concepts
-reported demographics


Results:  
-ideal and actual carried distinct variance
-EA valued HAP more, AA valued LAP more
