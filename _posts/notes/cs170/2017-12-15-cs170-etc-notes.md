#### Duality
Duality is the phenomenon where for any *primal* LP, there exists a *dual* LP that are both optimal for the same question.  The main idea is for any max LP, we can create a min LP that returns an upper bound for the primal question by introducing a set of non-negative multipliers.

#### How to find the Dual LP
1. Multiply each constraint by a multiplier, *y<sub>i</sub>*
2. Combine constraints into one inequality
3. Factor out the original *x<sub>i</sub>* variables
4. Use primal objective to write new dual and nonnegativity constraints

#### Max Flow
Given a directed graph with edge capacity constraints, send as many units of "flow" from the source *s* to the the sink *t*.
In order to find the max flow, keep sending units of flow through the shortest available path from s to t using BFS.

#### Using Max Flow to Solve Problems
* For "at most k" constraints, create edges leaving with capacity k.
* If constraint *A* belongs to only one constraint *B*, add edge of capacity 1.
* Add edge between constraints that satisfy each other.

#### Fermat's Little Theorem
Given a prime number, *p*, for any integer *a*:

>>a<sup>p</sup> = a (mod p)  
a<sup>p-1</sup> = 1 (mod p)

#### Miller-Rabin primality test
Given a number *p*, *p* is prime if and only if either:

>>a<sup>d</sup> = 1 (mod p)  
a<sup>2<sup>r</sup>*d</sup> = -1 (mod p)

is true for any *a*.
