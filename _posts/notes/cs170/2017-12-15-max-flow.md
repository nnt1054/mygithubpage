#### Max Flow
Given a directed graph with edge capacity constraints, send as many units of "flow" from the source *s* to the the sink *t*.
In order to find the max flow, keep sending units of flow through the shortest available path from s to t using BFS.

#### Using Max Flow to Solve Problems
* For "at most k" constraints, create edges leaving with capacity k.
* If constraint *A* belongs to only one constraint *B*, add edge of capacity 1.
* Add edge between constraints that satisfy each other.
