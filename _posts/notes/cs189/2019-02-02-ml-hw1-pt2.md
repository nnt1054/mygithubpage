Kaggle Competition:
MNIST Data Set:
-60,000 training data w/ labels
-10,000 test data I need to make predictions on
-Each data point is a vector of 784 pixel values b/w 0 and 255
-Supposed to actually be 28x28 array of pixels, but currently already flattened

Preprocessing Ideas:
-HOG: Histogram of Oriented Gradients
	- "counts occurences of gradient orientation in localized portions of an image" -wikipedia
	- the concept is basically observing the values in a small region and calculating the 

HOG Implementation:
- Gradient Computation:
	- gradient: a directional change in intensity or color (in this case we're looking at intensity first)
	- each gradient has orientation + magnitude
	-
