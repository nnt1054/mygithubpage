## Welcome!

Hey, thanks for checking out my blog!  In this Notes section, I'll be compiling and posting notes from my classes and studies (in a hopefully organized fashion).  The main purpose of this website is to help myself consolidate a stronger understanding and grasp of the larger ideas of my course content by forcing myself to review and summarize what I've learned.

I'm not too experienced with Markdown yet, so hopefully these posts will get better over time.
