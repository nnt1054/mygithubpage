#### Intro
The idea of my game is to create a TBS style game based off units and concepts of Starcraft.  I'm just gonna drop random unit ideas here for refernce later once I have the core game mechanics later.  A general issue I find with TBS games are that matches play out very slow, and individual decisions lack a sense of `impact` or flashiness.  Examples of impactful events in other games include:

- landing a nuke on the enemy's army in Starcarft
- big widow mine drops on an enemy supply line in Starcraft
- tempo swings and big combos in hearthstone
- only 5 players on a CS:GO team, so every kill makes a big difference

I want emphasize the idea of having less types of units, but making sure they all have very distinctive roles.  This in general helps with telegraphing a player's general strategies for counterplay and lowering the skill ceiling.

#### Main Archetypal Unit Types
* Offensive/Pushing
* Defensive/Stationary
* Utility Crowd Control
* Stealthly Traps
* Swarming Units
* Utility Transportation
* Assassin Glass Cannon
* Utility Healing Units
* Units that generate smaller weaker units
* Scouting Vision Units
* AOE Damage Units
* Debuff/Buff Units
* Infection Units
* Fake Decoy Units

#### Terran Style Units:

##### Marine
- main basic unit; weak ranged damage; does more consistent damage in large groups

##### Hellbat/Hellion
- main AOE unit; deals damage in a cone shape



I want to design units in a way where they enable a variety of fun VIABLE strategies.  I'm planning on making a more in-depth post about the flow of a game and overarching strategy concepts.  For inspiration, I want to make it so the following late game armies would be viable builds: 
* MASS basic ranged units: overwhelming the opponent with numbers and utilizing positioning and kiting to trade efficiently  
	* basic counter strategies would include more AOE units
* 1-2 Boss Units w/ Healers: steam rolling through the enemy with large powerful units and using healers to keep them alive
	* downsides would be a lack of mobility
	* counterplay strategies could include backdooring the opponents base or sniping down the healers first
* Strong Defensive Line, backed by Long Range Units: defending against opponents attacks and trying to outresource them in the grind game or slowly advancing towards the enemy base.
	* counterplay could include backdooring the opponents base, or using longer range sniping/special ability units to pick off the defensive line
	* forming a really strong defensive line will require more resources, so playing aggressively and farming more resources from the early game
* Building Structures hidden close to the enemy base to be aggressive and fight early.
	* counterplay would be scouting the structure early and defending with early defensive units; have to design this in a way where early all ins would have to be very resource intensive as an early game strategy
