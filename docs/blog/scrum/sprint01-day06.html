<h4 id="daily-objectives">Daily Objectives</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Draw out more infrastructure diagrams lmao</li>
  <li>Figure out what kind of business rules I can include</li>
  <li>Figure out the actual data design and models</li>
  <li>Get a node + express test application going</li>
  <li>Figure out deployment</li>
  <li>Figure out distribution or whatever it’s called</li>
</ol>

<p>Lmao this is uh a bonus sprint day!<br />
What did I accomplish from yesterday so that I don’t repeat things?</p>

<ol>
  <li>We’re definitely going with a Microservices architecture whether it’s the best decision or not</li>
  <li>:)</li>
</ol>

<p>First, I think for now we can ignore monitoring and logging.  I should definitely consider getting a minimum viable project going lol.</p>

<p>Next, Business Rules?  The question is, how will business rules affect the API’s at least?  They have software already arranged for handling business rules, so let’s start by looking at those.<br />
OpenRules is an open source “Business Rules and Decision Management System (BRDMS).”   Maybe rather than “Business Rules” I just focus on a system for roles and permissions.</p>

<p>Business Rules Roles and Permissions:<br />
I want to figure out first if Roles and Permissions deserve to be their own microservice.  “Backend service does not do jwt validation - it just trusts the gateway to send only valid requests.”  This implies that the interface needs to go through a gateway that checks the permissions.<br />
Can try to assume that every call to an internal service will originate from another service.</p>

<p>Ok so we want to differentiate, the ‘Microservices’ from the ‘User Interfaces’.  The more I read about microservices architecture, the more I feel like this isn’t the right thing to do :)
Use an API Gateway as a ‘single entry point to the rest of the microservices’.<br />
Interprocess Communication (IPC) styles: One-to-one, One-to-many, synchronous, asynchronous, messaged-based, pub/sub, REST,</p>

<p>“May I ask why would you bother build a distributed system when you are not going to distribute it at all ?” LOL I’m getting called out so hard<br />
Ignoring this, want to remember I’ll be using a ‘SHARED DATABASE’ between different microservices.  I want to give the option of separating the databases.  For now the different databases would be for ‘content/schemas’, ‘users/roles/permissions’, ‘site repos/web hosting’.</p>

<p>Wait, so how would web hosting work?  Also should I just have an API gateway for handling everything?  I’m completely defeating the purpose of a microservices architecture by trying to not even make it distributed.  I don’t want to completely abandon the idea though so let’s brainstorm what I can do.  It’s gonna be an open source project, so the ideal is to make it plug and play for the most part, but I also want to make sure it’s scalable for others if they want it as a microservice architecture.  So to reiterate, let’s assume the project is two services and an API gateway?  The API gateway process requests and sends them to the correct area.</p>

<p>How can I host subdomains?  How can I dynamically create new subdomains?</p>
