<h4 id="daily-objectives">Daily Objectives</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Get ‘TetrisInstance’ Script working</li>
  <li>Make an outline of the project/game engine structure</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<p>The scope of the project has somehow branched into a mini game ‘engine’
* Need a system for scenes
* Need a system for ‘game objects’, prefabs
* Think in terms of Unity, objects and components
* Objects need a way to:
	* Render
	* Update
* Mainly concerned with how to manage ‘animations’ that take non negligible times to display
	* Every moving object needs a timer, change to the next frame of an animation everytime delta amount of time
* Global way of referencing scripts?
* Lmao need to split everything between:
	* Game Engine
	* Game Development Interface
	* Actual HECKING Game</p>

<p>What does the Game Engine need to know and do?
* Update the correct objects
* Render the correct objects
* Need to establish a current Scene
	* Within the scene there’s a list of active objects
		* Active objects could have a list of active objects
	* Scene updates and draws all the active objects in specific orders
* What information needs to be passed between Engine → Scene → Objects
	* Mostly just time, and timers? The scene shouldn’t have to keep track of the uh global timer/clock
	* The scene should calculate everything based off ‘update ticks’
	* The engine should only update the current scene when there’s an ‘update tick’
	* This is mostly kinda explained already, but I want to create a bit of abstraction between entities.
	* So other objects within the game can update based off the current update tick instead of having to worry about the entire ‘time delta’ mumbo jumbo
	* Ok ^^ that statement made things make sense for me
	* GAME OBJECTS ASSUME THEIR UPDATE FUNCTIONS ARE CALLED AT DISCRETE TIME PERIODS
	* THE GAME ENGINE MAKES SURE THE GAME OBJECTS CAN MAKE THAT ASSUMPTION
	* I MEANT TO SAY ‘GAME FRAMEWORK’ instead of ‘GAME ENGINE’
* How do I write sufficient documentation for this
* BTW SPRINT IS EXTENDED ALONG WITH THE PROJECT SCOPE</p>
