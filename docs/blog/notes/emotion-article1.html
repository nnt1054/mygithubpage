    <p>Concerns:
- ensure both sets are simple random samples of the data
- make sure code is optimized for large data sets
- only load/parse in “training” and “validation” partitions instead of entire data set</p>

<p>Affect Valuation Theory:
- “ideal affect”: how people want to feel<br />
- “actual affect”: how people actually feel<br />
ideal and actual affects differ, and cultural factors has bigger influence on the “ideal”
note: HAP, LAP = high, low arousal positive states</p>

<p>EA’s value high-arousal positive affects, while CH/AA value low-arousal positive affects; this can be tied into differences of ‘self-concept’ between cultures (EA’s value more indivuality, CH/AA value self-concepts regarding social roles)</p>

<p>Ideal Affect Differs from Actual Affect<br />
emotional experience expressed through: valence, arousal
-pure and interactive component (overlapping/non-overlapping variance between ideal and actual)</p>

<p>Cultural Factors Shape Ideal Affect<br />
goal: examine whether ideal and actual differ, culture influences ideal more than actual</p>

<p>Study 1:<br />
-participants asked “how would you IDEALLY like to feel b/w slightly and extremely
-then asked to “rate how much you TYPICALLY feel each of the following items on average”
-administered self-construal test which assesses individualistic and collectivistic self-concepts
-reported demographics</p>

<p>Results:<br />
-ideal and actual carried distinct variance
-EA valued HAP more, AA valued LAP more</p>
