    <h4 id="affect-valuation-theory">Affect Valuation Theory:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Proposal: Ideal and Actual affects differ, and cultural factors have a bigger influence on the ideal compared to the actual</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="definitions">Definitions:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>“ideal affect”: how people want to feel</li>
  <li>“actual affect”: how people actually feel</li>
  <li>HAP, LAP: high, low arousal positive states</li>
  <li>Culture: operationzalied as country-of-origin</li>
  <li>Emotions: only the affective and affective states are observed in this study (although its only considered one aspect of emotions in Emotional Psychology)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ideal-affect-differs-from-actual-affect">Ideal Affect Differs from Actual Affect:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>emotional experience expressed through: valence (positive/negative) and arousal (calmness/excitement)</li>
  <li>pure and interactive component (overlapping/non-overlapping variance between ideal and actual affects)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="study-1">Study 1:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Hypothesis: Ideal affect is different across different cultural constructs</li>
  <li>Particpants chosen were either European American (EA) or Asian American (AA) students</li>
  <li>Participants were asked to complete surveys to determine their “Affect Valuation Index” (AVI), self-construal (individualistic or collectivistic natures)</li>
  <li>Results: EA students seemed to favor HAP compared to AA students</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="study-2">Study 2:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Conducted the same experiment as Study 1, except with Chinese students from Hong Kong (CH).</li>
  <li>Included temperament, infulence/adjustment goals, and personality traits in the survey</li>
  <li>Results: CH students valued LAP, EA valued HAP, and CA valued both.  EA students not achieving their HAP led to higher depressions scores.</li>
</ul>

<p><b> Summary: </b> personality explains actual affects, while culture influences pure ideal affects.</p>

<h4 id="personal-thoughts-and-reflections">Personal Thoughts and Reflections:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>EA’s value high-arousal positive affects, while CH/AA value low-arousal positive affects; this can be tied into differences of ‘self-concept’ between cultures (EA’s value more indivuality, CH/AA value self-concepts regarding social roles)</li>
  <li>From Pyschology of Personality, culture was rather a strong influencer on a person’s “self-concept”, where East Asian cultures led to self-concepts pertaining to “social roles”, and Euro-American leading to more individualistic.  The different self-concepts affected how people apprasied and reacted (emotionally) to different situations.  So differences in emotional affects could rather be a byproduct from personalities influenced by cultures, as opposed to directly influenced by the culture.</li>
  <li>From Pyschology of Personality, higher depression scores were due to having poorer social goals, which stems from EA’s more individualistic definition of success.</li>
</ul>
