    <h4 id="reductions">Reductions:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A –&gt; B means reducing an algorithm A to an algorithm B</li>
  <li>Reducing an algorithm A to B creates an instance <em>f</em>(<em>I</em>) from the original instance, <em>I</em>, that can then be used with the algorithm B.  The solution <em>S</em> can then be used to get <em>h</em>(<em>S</em>) which is the solution for A.</li>
  <li>If an algorithm A can be reduced to another algorithm B, that means B is <strong>at least</strong> as hard as A.

</ul>

<h4 id="definitions">Definitions:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>P: The set of all problems that can be verified and solved in polynomial time.</li>
  <li>NP: The set of all problems that can be verified in polynomial time.</li>
  <li>NP-Hard: The set of all problems that are at least as hard as the hardest questions in NP
    <ul>
      <li>This means that a problem is NP-Hard iff every problem in NP can be reduced to it in polynomial time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>NP-Complete: The subset of NP-Hard problems that can be verified in polynomial time.</li>
  <li>What does the <em>N</em> in <em>NP</em> mean? It means non-deterministic because these problems can only be solved in a non-deterministic polynomial time.</li>
  <li>Verifiable: A solution to an algorithm can be verified as a correct solution to the problem in polynomial time.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-to-show-np-completeness">How to show NP-Completeness:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>To show a problem is in NP:
    <ul>
      <li>Verify the problem can be solved in polynomial time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To show a problem is NP-Hard:
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce an NP-Hard or NP-Complete problem to the problem</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To prove a problem is NP-Complete, show a solution can be verified in polynomial time.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="list-of-common-np-hard-problems">List of Common NP-Hard Problems</h4>
