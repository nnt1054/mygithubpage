<ol>
  <li>criminal must be mentioned in the early part of the story, but not someone the reader can follow their thoughts</li>
  <li>supernatural and prenatural agencies are ruled out as a matter of course</li>
  <li>not more than one secrete room of passage is allowable</li>
  <li>no undiscovered poisons or any appliances that require long scientific explanations</li>
  <li>no chinaman must figure in the story (???)</li>
  <li>no accidents can help the detective, nor unaccountable intuitions be proved correct</li>
  <li>detective himself cannot commit the crime</li>
  <li>the detective must not light on any clues which are not instantly produced for the inspection of the reader</li>
  <li>the ‘stupid friend of the detective’, must not conceal any thoughts which pass through their mind; their intelligence must be slightly below that of the average reader</li>
  <li>twin brothers and doubles must not appear unless they’ve been duly prepared for them</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="ss-van-dine-20-rules-for-writing-detective-stories">S.S. Van Dine: 20 Rules for Writing Detective Stories</h5>
<ol>

  <li>no wilful tricks may be played on the reader other than those legitimized by the detective or criminal themselves</li>
  <li>no love interest in the story</li>
  <li>the detective should not turn out the culprit</li>
  <li>culprit must be determined by logical deductions</li>
  <li>detective novels must have a detective that plays the functional role of the detective</li>
  <li>there must be a corpse; the deader the corpse the better</li>
  <li>problem of the crime must be solved through naturalistic means</li>
  <li>there must only be one detective</li>
  <li>culprit must have been someone that played somewhat of a prominent role in the story</li>

  <li>there must only be one culprit, but may have minor helpers or co-plotters</li>
  <li>secret societies have no place in a detective novel</li>
  <li>method/means of murder must be rational and scientific</li>
  <li>the truth of the problem must at all times be apparent; if re-read, the reader should be able to point out the clues that lead to the culprit</li>
  <li>should not contain any long descriptive passages</li>
  <li>professional criminals shouldn’t be shouldered with the guilt of crime</li>
  <li>a crime should never turn out to be an accident or a suicide</li>
  <li>the motives for all crimes should be personal</li>
  <li>avoid following situations as they’ve been overused and overdone…</li>
