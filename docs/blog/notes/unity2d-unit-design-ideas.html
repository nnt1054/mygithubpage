<p>The idea of my game is to create a TBS style game based off units and concepts of Starcraft.  I’m just gonna drop random unit ideas here for refernce later once I have the core game mechanics later.  A general issue I find with TBS games are that matches play out very slow, and individual decisions lack a sense of <code class="highlighter-rouge">impact</code> or flashiness.  Examples of impactful events in other games include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>landing a nuke on the enemy’s army in Starcarft</li>
  <li>big widow mine drops on an enemy supply line in Starcraft</li>
  <li>tempo swings and big combos in hearthstone</li>
  <li>only 5 players on a CS:GO team, so every kill makes a big difference</li>
</ul>

<p>I want emphasize the idea of having less types of units, but making sure they all have very distinctive roles.  This in general helps with telegraphing a player’s general strategies for counterplay and lowering the skill ceiling.</p>

<h4 id="main-archetypal-unit-types">Main Archetypal Unit Types</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Offensive/Pushing</li>
  <li>Defensive/Stationary</li>
  <li>Utility Crowd Control</li>
  <li>Stealthly Traps</li>
  <li>Swarming Units</li>
  <li>Utility Transportation</li>
  <li>Assassin Glass Cannon</li>
  <li>Utility Healing Units</li>
  <li>Units that generate smaller weaker units</li>
  <li>Scouting Vision Units</li>
  <li>AOE Damage Units</li>
  <li>Debuff/Buff Units</li>
  <li>Infection Units</li>
  <li>Fake Decoy Units</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="terran-style-units">Terran Style Units:</h4>

<h5 id="marine">Marine</h5>
<ul>
  <li>main basic unit; weak ranged damage; does more consistent damage in large groups</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="hellbathellion">Hellbat/Hellion</h5>
<ul>
  <li>main AOE unit; deals damage in a cone shape</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to design units in a way where they enable a variety of fun VIABLE strategies.  I’m planning on making a more in-depth post about the flow of a game and overarching strategy concepts.  For inspiration, I want to make it so the following late game armies would be viable builds:</p>
<ul>
  <li>MASS basic ranged units: overwhelming the opponent with numbers and utilizing positioning and kiting to trade efficiently
    <ul>
      <li>basic counter strategies would include more AOE units</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1-2 Boss Units w/ Healers: steam rolling through the enemy with large powerful units and using healers to keep them alive
    <ul>
      <li>downsides would be a lack of mobility</li>
      <li>counterplay strategies could include backdooring the opponents base or sniping down the healers first</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Strong Defensive Line, backed by Long Range Units: defending against opponents attacks and trying to outresource them in the grind game or slowly advancing towards the enemy base.
    <ul>
      <li>counterplay could include backdooring the opponents base, or using longer range sniping/special ability units to pick off the defensive line</li>
      <li>forming a really strong defensive line will require more resources, so playing aggressively and farming more resources from the early game</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Building Structures hidden close to the enemy base to be aggressive and fight early.
    <ul>
      <li>counterplay would be scouting the structure early and defending with early defensive units; have to design this in a way where early all ins would have to be very resource intensive as an early game strategy</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
